Project Title: CPU Scheduling Simulation
________________________________________

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop and compare various CPU scheduling algorithms that determine the order of task execution. These algorithms aim to optimize system performance by improving key performance metrics, such as waiting time, turnaround time.

Problem Description:
A CPU is responsible for executing multiple tasks (or processes) in a computer system. In a multitasking environment, the CPU scheduler is the component that determines which task will be executed at a given point in time.

Each task has:

  •	A burst time (or execution time), which is the amount of time the task requires for the CPU to process it.
  
  •	A priority (in some algorithms), which indicates the importance of the task.
  
  •	An arrival time, which specifies when the task arrives in the system.
  
The goal of this project is to implement several CPU scheduling algorithms, compare their performance, and determine which one optimizes the CPU's effectiveness based on the specific metrics of interests.

Performance Metrics :
  1.	Waiting Time (WT): The total time a task spends waiting in the ready queue before it is executed.
  2.	Turnaround Time (TAT): The total time from when a task arrives to when it finishes execution. It includes waiting time and burst time.

CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
Here are a few common CPU scheduling algorithms that will be implemented in this simulation:
  1)	First Come, First Serve (FCFS)
  2)	Shortest Job First (SJF)
  3)	Round Robin (RR)
  4)	Priority Scheduling

Implementation Steps:

Define Task Structure: Create a data structure to store task details (arrival time, burst time, priority).

Implement Scheduling Algorithms:
  1.	Implement each algorithm, ensuring that the task selection process follows the algorithm's rules.
  2.	For algorithms like Round Robin, handle the time quantum appropriately.

Track Performance Metrics:
  1.	Waiting Time: Calculate the time each task spends in the ready queue.
  2.	Turnaround Time: Calculate the total time from task arrival to completion.

Comparison: After running simulations for each algorithm, compare their performance based on the key metrics:
  1.	Which algorithm results in the lowest waiting time?
  2.	Which algorithm minimizes Turn around time?

Expected Results:

  The output of the simulation will show performance metrics for each algorithm, including:
  
    1.	Average Waiting Time (WT)
    
    2.	Average Turnaround Time (TAT)
    
  The results will allow you to determine which algorithm performs best in terms of minimizing waiting time, reducing turnaround time.

Conclusion:
  This simulation will help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of various CPU scheduling algorithms. By comparing the performance metrics, you can make informed decisions about which scheduling algorithm to use for a given system, depending on the specific requirements (e.g., real-time systems, batch processing, or interactive systems)
